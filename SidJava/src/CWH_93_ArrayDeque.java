/*
 It is a resizable, array-backed deque that provides constant time complexity for adding or removing elements from both the beginning and the end of the deque.

 Note:We can add/remove the array elements in start of the array or ending of an array. we use arrayDeque methods to achive this.
  addFirst throws exception                     offerFirst (Without exception)
  addLast throws exception                      offerLast(Without exception)
  removeFirst  throws exception                 pollFirst(Without exception)
  removeLast  throws exception                  polLast(Without exception)
  getFirst()    throws exception                peekFirst(Without exception)
  getLast()  throws exception                   peekLast()(Without exception)
